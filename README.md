This code steps through a PTRAC file generated by MCNP and creates a PoliMi-like output, with a few caveats. The main reason for its development was to obtain directional information about nuclear recoils.

This code has only been tested with PTRAC files generated from MCNPX-PoliMi, which appear to be modified by PoliMi. As a result, some non-physical PTRAC events exist, and this code makes some assumptions to handle these. 

Use this code at your own risk and responsibility.

Requires AME20 mass text files, and levels data. Happy to provide additional support/guidance as needed.
